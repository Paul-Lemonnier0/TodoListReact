# ***React Native*** starter **(TodoList)**

This is the ***React Native*** version of the todolist starter applications.

-- This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app). --


## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   ***Or***

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go)

First of all, download the **Expo Go** app. Then, scan the **generated QR Code**. Note that if you can't or don't want to download this app, you will have to use an **emulator** (Xcode, Android Studio).

## Reset the project

If you want to reset the project, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
